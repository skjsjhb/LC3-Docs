## Tasks

Create a program to check whether a given string is palindromic.

- String length: `x3100`

- String: starts from `x3101`

- Output: `x3200`

## Requirements

- `R0` to `R7` has been cleared for you (in this lab only).

- The string **doesn't always end with a zero**.

- All letters of the string needs be counted.

- Patterns of odd or even letters are both acceptable.

- The output value is limited to `0` and `1`.
