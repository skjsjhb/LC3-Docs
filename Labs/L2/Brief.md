# Lab 2: Checked by LC-3 (Brief Edition)

## Tasks

Verify the Collatz conjecture for a given number. Count the steps it takes to become 1.

- Input: `x3100`

- Output: `x3101`

## Requirements

- Use **LC-3 assembly** to create the program. Formatting is recommended.

- Program starts at `x3000`.

- Do not forget to use `HALT`.

- Input number ranges from 1 to 99 (inclusive).

- Do not copy.

## Submission

Similar to Lab 1, but using assembly. Assembly files usually have `.asm` as their filename extension.
